# web_scraping
#### Collection of my web scraping projects.

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| [Amazon](https://github.com/israel-dryer/Amazon-Scraper) | product and price data |
| [Yahoo! Finance](https://github.com/israel-dryer/Yahoo-Finance-Scraper) | financial, company and historical stock data |

## Requirements
A few of these projects use browser automation, but most do not. For this, I use **Selenium** to automate the browser.  Other libraries that are used include:
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- lxml
