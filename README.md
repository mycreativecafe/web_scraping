# Web Scraping
#### Collection of my web scraping projects.

|---|---|
| [Amazon](https://github.com/mycreativecafe/YahooFinanceScraper) | product and price data |

## Requirements
One of these projects use browser automation, but other do not. For this, I use **Selenium** to automate the browser.  Other libraries that are used include:
